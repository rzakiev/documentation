# Tab 3: Market Watch

### Introduction

The third tab of the ETNA Trader web app is called **Market Watch** and its main purpose is to display the securities in your watchlist. As a trader, you always track certain securities to keep up-to-date with their trading volume and their market price fluctuations. And this is exactly what you'll find in the first widget of this tab â€” **Watchlist**. This article demonstrates how you can use this widget to create watchlists, add new securities to the existing watchlists, and also how you can monitor the trading information associated with each of these securities. 

### Watchlist

The watchlist widget represents a table that contains a particular watchlist. You can create multiples watchlists if you need to split your securities into groups \(for example, by industry\). Each watchlist contains various trading information associated with a particular security, including:

1. **Symbol**. This is the ticker symbol under which the security is traded on the stock exchange. 
2. **Description**. This is usually the name of the underlying company or ETF.
3. **Last.** This is the price at which the last trade was executed before the closing time.
4. **Last Size**. This is the trade volume of the last executed trade.
5. **Bid**. This is the highest current price that traders are willing to pay for the security.
6. **Bid size**. This is the trade volume of the current bid price.
7. **Ask**. This is the lowest current price at which traders are willing to sell the security.
8. **Ask Size**. This is the volume of the current ask price.
9. **Change**. The difference between the security's closing price from the previous day and the current market price \(on the absolute basis\).
10. **Change %**. The difference between the security's closing price from the previous day and the current market price \(in percentage terms\).
11. **Open**. This is the price at which the first trade of the day was executed.
12. **Day High**. This is the highest price at which the security was traded during the day. 
13. **Day Low**. This is the lowest price at which the security was traded during the day. 
14. **Close**. This is the price at which the last trade of the day was executed.
