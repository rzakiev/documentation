# Trading Accounts

### Introduction

In ETNA Trader, a trading account is a separate entity used for performing trades. Whenever you need to purchase or sell some security, you must have an active trading account that was approved by a clearing firm who handles the confirmation, settlement, and delivery of transactions. The clearing firm can also reject trades if, for example, the account's equity falls below a certain level.

Trading accounts are distinct from users, as one user might have multiple trading accounts and vice versa. For example, a user might have separate trading accounts for stock trading, options trading, and Forex trading. Similarly, one trading account might have multiple associated users. For example, all members of a family are using the same account to place orders.

Trading accounts can be created in one of the two following ways:

1. Through ETNA Trader's [web terminal]();  

 

2. Through our [private REST API]().

As an administrator, you need to review each newly created trading account before ETNA Trader sends it for review to the clearing firm. After the account is approved by the clearing firm, it is becomes active and can be used to perform trades.

### Account Types

All trading accounts fall into one of the three FINRA-defined types: _Cash_, _Margin_, and _Day Trader_. 

| Account  Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cash | This type of account only permits trading operations with the trader's funds  without the ability to trade on margin. Cash accounts are not allowed to open short positions and write call and put options \(except for covered calls\). |
| Margin | In addition to personal funds, margin accounts permit trading with borrowed money. As per FINRA's requirements, the owner of a margin account can trade on margin only if their equity is no less than $2'000. If the owner's equity falls below the $2'000 mark due to market fluctuations, the account is automatically converted to _Cash_. If at that point the account has any short or margin positions, the owner will get a required maintenance call. |
| Day Trader | This type of margin account is aimed at day traders and allows them to buy and sell the same security on the same trade date. To qualify for the day trader account, the owner of the account should have at least $25'000 of equity. If the equity falls below the $25'000 mark due to market fluctuations, the owner of the account will get an equity maintenance call the next business day. |

Each of these types has its own requirements; if they are not met, the account becomes inactive and the user can no longer perform trades.

### Account Access Level

If you've created a new trading account, it's not automatically available to any of your company's users — it has to be bound to each user individually. Binding trading accounts to users can be done through:

* **BO Users** widget

 

* ETNA Trader's [private REST API]().

During the binding process, you have to specify the access level that the user must have when operating this trading account.

| Access Level Value | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- |
| Full | **Full**. All operations are allowed. |
| ReadOnly | **Read Only**. The user can only examine the existing orders and positions \(without having the ability to place new orders or modify the existing ones\). |
| ClosePositionsOnly | **Close Positions Only**. The user can only close the positions without the ability to open new ones. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Access Level Value must be specified only when an account is bound to a user via ETNA Trader's [REST API]().
{% endhint %}

### Trading Account Parameters

Each trading account consists of an array of different parameters, some of which are retrieved from the clearing firm — **base parameters** — while others are dynamically calculated based on the aforementioned base parameters.

Some these parameters can be examined in the **Account Info** widget.

Let's examine each of these parameters in detail.

### Cash

Cash indicates the amount of funds that the account's user can withdraw or spend to open new positions. 

### NetCash

NetCash represents the amount of available funds adjusted for the option maintenance margin. It is calculated according to the following formula:

$$
NetCash = Cash - OptionMaintenanceMargin
$$

### Base Cash

Base cash is an indicator that is retrieved daily from the clearing firm.

### Pending Cash

Pending Cash indicates the amount of money that is reserved to carry out current transactions. This reserve is withheld from the Cash parameter and it is calculated as the sum of the transaction commission and the cost of the securities purchased during the transaction.

$$
Pending Cash = Σ Commissions + ΣOrderCost
$$

### Account Value

Account value represents the sum of the available Cash and the aggregate market value of all long and short positions.

$$
AccountValue = Cash + Market Value
$$

### Market Value

Market Value represents the sum of four other trading account parameters:

1. stockLongMarketValue — the aggregate market value of all long positions in stocks.
2. stockShortMarketValue — the aggregate market value of all short positions in stocks.
3. optionLongMarketValue — the aggregate market value of all long positions in options.
4. optionShortMarketValue — the aggregate market value of all short positions in options.

$$
MarketValue = stockLongMarketValue + stockShortMarketValue + optionLongMarketValue + optionShortMarketValue
$$

### Excess

Excess represents the available funds that can be used to open new positions. This is a base parameter that is retrieved daily from the clearing firm. Throughout the trading session, this parameter is calculated differently depending on the configuration of your environment:

* **Default**

$$
Excess = Cash + StockMarketValue - MaintenanceMargin - PendingCash
$$

* **Real-time Excess**

$$
Excess=Cash+StockMarketValue−MaintenanceMargin−PendingCash
$$

* **Excess with Unsettled Cash**

$$
Excess = Base Cash - UnsettledCash - PendingCash
$$

### Excess Back

Excess back is in most cases identical to Base Cash except for the **Real-time Excess** configuration where it is calculated as:

$$
ExcessBack = Equity - MaintenanceMargin
$$

### Equity

Equity represents the sum of Cash and the net market value of all positions in stocks:

$$
Equity = Cash + StockMarketValue
$$



$$
StockMarketValue = StockLongMarketValue + StockShortMarketValue
$$
