# API Documentation Feedback

The API documentation seems OK for the most part, although I hesitate to give conclusive feedback until I've actually tested the API myself and verified that it's accurate. 

What I've noticed is that most of the pages lack the introduction, so it might be quite confusing for the readers. When a user opens any page of the documentation, they should immedately understand where they are and what is the purpose of the article they're reading. 

I'd also add some sample Python code to the API because code is usually more readable to humans than English.

Also, I'm not sure if it's intentional, but the API reference is extremely long, I'd probably split it in a few digestible sections.
