# Renewing Licenses

## Renewing Licenses

When you purchase a set of licenses for your users in one transaction, all these licenses are automatically renewed every year. And that holds true for all completed transactions. For example, if you purchase 100 licenses for _company A_ on June 1st, 2018, these 100 licenses will automatically be renewed on June 1st, 2019.

Let's suppose auto-renewal failed because your debit card had expired. In this case our service will attempt to renew these 100 licenses from the global license pool. If you don't want our service to renew these licenses from the global pool, go to the Web Console settings and deselect the _Automatic exchange of expired license with available_ checkbox.

You may want to disable this checkbox to ensure that, for example, licenses from _transaction A_ are exclusively assigned to _company A_ and licenses from other transactions will not be assigned to users of _company A_ because auto-renewal failed for licenses from _transaction A_.

If this checkbox is enabled, failure to renew certain licenses will lead to assignment of other licenses from the global pool to your users.

Expired trial licenses are displayed with a red key on the left and can be renewed by clicking **Grant**.
