# Managing Transactions

## Managing Transactions

When you purchase multiple licenses, all these licenses are automatically assigned to one transaction. Many of our customers prefer to match these transactions with certain companies for more convenient license management. For instance, 10 licenses were purchased in transaction A for company A. If company A requires a few extra licenses, these licenses will have to be purchased in a separate transaction which would make it more difficult to match this company's licenses with a particular transaction.

To deal with this issue, MSP Backups Web Console allows modification of multiple licenses' transaction with the help of a group action. To do that, select the required licenses and click on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner. Click **Change transaction**:

Select the required transaction and click **Apply**. The licenses will then be assigned to the selected transaction.
