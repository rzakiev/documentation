# Licensing Technicalities

## Licensing Technicalities

While the initial license allocation may seem straightforward at first, it is worth to examine the lifecycle of a license a little further to avoid being caught off guard when performing regular procedures like assigning a user to a different company, deleting user accounts, and so forth.

### Assigning a user to a different company

Assigning a user to a different company may result in moving this user's paid licenses to another pool, which depends on the licensing mode used by both of these companies.

* If the previous company uses the global license pool and the new company uses its own company pool, the user's activated licenses are handed over to the new company's pool and the rest of the user's licenses are moved to the global pool where they become available to users from other companies.
* If the new company uses its own license pool, this user's activated licenses will move to this company's pool. 
* If the new company uses a custom licensing mode, this user's activated licenses will move to the global or user's personal pool, depending on the licensing mode specified for the new company. 
* If the new company uses the global licensing pool, this user's activated licenses will move to the global pool.

### Moving Non-Activated Licenses

If a company enables its users to have personal license pools, a user's pool can contain non-activated licenses. Where these licenses will be moved after assigning a user to a different company depends on the licensing mode specified for the newly assigned company:

* If the new company uses the global licensing pool, a user's non-activated licenses will move to the global pool. 
* If the new company uses its own license pool, a user's non-activated licenses will move to this company's pool. 
* Finally, if the target company uses a custom licensing mode, non-activated licenses will remain in this user's personal pool.

### Deleting a user account

When deleting a user account, this user's licenses will return to either the global or to the company's pool, depending on which pool was used to obtain licenses by this user:

* If the user's licenses were obtained from the global or personal pool, these licenses will return to the global pool. 
* If a user's licenses were obtained from a company's pool, these licenses will return back to the pool of this company.
