# Overview

## Introduction

Managed Backup Service \(MBS\) is a SaaS solution that operates on a subscription-based model. All subscriptions are monthly-based with prices varying based on the complexity of the required backup. For example, backing up individual files will only cost $6/month per computer, while backing up VMware virtual machines will require a different license that costs $15/month.

As a provider, you have to purchase a separate subscription for each computer that requires data backup. For example, if you administer 10 users — each with two computers — you will need to purchase 20 monthly subscriptions in order for them to perform backup.

MSP Backups is distributed on a per-computer basis, meaning each computer requires a separate license to be able to perform backups. If one user has multiple computers, each of these computers requires a separate license.

Licenses can be purchased in bulk and thereby shape a global pool or they can be purchased in separate transactions that can be matched with particular companies.

## Use-Case Scenario

The following use-case scenario demonstrates how and when you will be charged for using 50 Desktop/Server licenses in a hypothetical time period that spans from late November till March.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1.Sign up for MBS on **Nov 25**. Required licenses: 50 Desktop/Server licenses  \($3/month each — including the 50% volume discount\). | You're billed **$100** for the initial minimum deposit which converts into $100 worth of MBS credit. **$25** is charged to your MBS credit for the remaining **5 days** of November \(50 licenses \* $3 / 30 days \* 5 days\). Remaining MBS credit: **$75** \($100 - $25\). |
| 2. Use MBS throughout December. | You're billed **$100** \(minimum transaction\) because your **$75** is not enough to cover the cost of MBS which is **$150** \(50 licenses \* $3 \* 30 days\). Remaining credit: **$175**. **$150** is charged to your MBS credit on Dec 1st. Remaining MBS credit: **$25** \($175 - $150\). |
| 3. Use MBS throughout January. | You're billed **$125** because your **$25** is not enough to cover the cost of MBS \($150\). Remaining credit: **$150**. **$150** is charged to your MBS credit for the month of January.  Remaining credit: **$0** \($150 - $150\). |
| 4. Use MBS throughout February. | You're billed **$150** to pay for February. Remaining credit: **$150**. **$150** is charged to your MBS credit for February. Remaining credit: **$0** \($150 - $150\). |
| 5. Use MBS throughout March. | See February. |
