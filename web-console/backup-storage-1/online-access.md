# Online Access

### Accessing data online

Managed Backup Service has the Online Access feature. The Online Access functionality offers customers an efficient and secure way to view their backup content and ensure that vital data is properly backed up. It offers the ability to download data hosted in the cloud and share a link to it with other authorized parties.

Having purchased an [Advanced Rebranding](https://order.shareit.com/cart/new?vendorid=200082138&PRODUCT[300577211]=1) license, online access can be configured directly from the owner's domain. Also for enhanced security, an SSL certificate can be installed and used to encrypt the connections in order to ensure that data can be safely accessed from anywhere in the world.

### Setting up online access for users

Following is the list of steps required to enable online access:

**Step 1.** Open the **Settings** tab and click **Online Access**.

**Step 2.** Select **Allow my users online access to their backup data** option.

**Step 3.** Specify your desired alias name. This name will be appended to the end of the site's URL address. It is recommended to create brief and easily recognizable aliases. After saving your settings, a new URL address will be automatically generated and displayed in properties.

**Note**: by default, the Cloudberry Lab's domain is used for the generated URL.

**Step 4 \(Advanced\).** Now that you have an [Advanced Rebranding](https://order.shareit.com/cart/new?vendorid=200082138&PRODUCT[300577211]=1) license, proceed to configure an online access with your **own domain**.

To configure the custom domain, point your domain name to 52.6.7.137 IP address and write your domain name \(for example, online.yourcompany.com\) to the **DNS** field. 

Make sure to specify your DNS name into the field:

**Step 5.** To adorn users' interface with your custom logo, insert the URL of the image into the corresponding field of the **Rebranding** section. After saving your settings, you will see a logo preview. To confirm you logo, click **Save**.

### Enabling SSL certificate \(Advanced\)

In order to protect online sessions from illegal viewing, you can configure secure access to the data using SSL certificate.

To configure Online Access with SSL requires the following steps:  
1. You need to have your own domain name pointed to 52.6.7.137 IP address \(see Step 4\).  
2. You need to have a valid SSL certificate with a private key.

Then you need to send the SSL certificate including the private key file \(.pfx\) to CloudBerry Lab \([support@cloudberrylab.com](mailto:support@cloudberrylab.com</)\) so that we can set up it on our server to configure SSL access for you.

**This feature can be enabled for an annual payment of $59.99.**

### Viewing data online on the client side

Users can view their backed up data by going to the generated URL and entering their username \(i.e. email\) and password. The provider informs their users what URL they can use for online access.

Step 1. Go to the online access URL.

Step 2. Enter login \(i.e. user's email\) and password. Click **Login**.

**Note**: Only the users configured on the **"Users" tab** can use Online Access.

After entering the required credentials, users are directed to the inventory view listing all their backup content. Users can then browse the files and folders of their store, download the objects and create links to them to share with others.
