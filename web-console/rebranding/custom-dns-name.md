# Custom DNS name

As a service provider you may want to use a custom domain name instead of "mspbackups.com" to access the MBS Web Console.

To enable this option, perform the following steps:

1. Point your domain name to **52.6.7.137** IP address. Example: mspbackups.com

For enhanced security you can also set up an SSL certificate to encrypt the connections in order to ensure that data can be safely accessed from anywhere in the world.

1. Send the SSL certificate **including the private key file \(.pfx\)** to CloudBerry Lab \([support@cloudberrylab.com](mailto:support@cloudberrylab.com</)\) with subject **"MBS custom domain for Control Panel"** so that we can set up it on our server to configure SSL access for you.

**This feature can be used for an annual payment of $59.99.**
