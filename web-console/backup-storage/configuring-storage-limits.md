# Configuring Storage Limits

Storage limits restrict the volume of data users can store in backup storage. Apart from data volume, they also enable you to specify the monetary threshold for each user to keep storage costs under control. For example, you can prevent your users from backing up more than 100 GB of data and spending more than $20 for all backup-related purposes.

To create a storage limit, go to _Storage Limits_, under _Storage_. Click **Add New**.

5. **Storage Cost limit**. In US dollars.

Storage Limits are not automatically assigned to users by default. They have to be configured individually for every user in the user's settings.
