# Signing Up for Azure

To start using MSP Backups with Microsoft Azure, you need to configure an Azure account. Following is the manual describing how to sign up to Microsoft Azure services and create a storage account.

To get started with Azure, go to [Microsoft Azure website](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/).

Click **START FREE**.

You can either create an entirely new account or log in with your existing Microsoft credentials. Enter your personal information and click **Next**.

You will then need to confirm your identity with a text message and a debit card.

Specify all of the required options and click **Create**.

## **Retrieving Access Keys**

To start working with Managed Backup Service you need to generate **Azure access keys**.

In the Azure Management Portal, under your storage account, click **Access Keys**. Here you can generate keys or use the default ones.

Write down the credentials somewhere; we're gonna need them in the MBS Web Console.
