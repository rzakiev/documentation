# Creating Companies

To help manage large quantities of users, it might be useful to combine them into companies for better user management and company-specific settings. In fact, it is more convenient to first create companies and then add users to them. That way you don't need to specify storage limits for all users individually.

To create a company, go to _Companies_, under _Users_. Click **Create Company**.
