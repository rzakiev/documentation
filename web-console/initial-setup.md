# Getting Started

When you open the MBS Web Console for the first time, you will be presented with the _Getting Started_ wizard. By default, we provide you with 2 GB of free storage. You will later be able to use your own storage if necessary.

Next, you'll be prompted to download the build for your operating system. Our service automatically detects the OS you're running and accordingly assembles the required build.

The configuration process is now complete. You can go ahead and create the first user, specify your own storage credentials, and start backing up your data.

After clicking **Finish** you will be redirected to the MBS control panel. Here's how it initially looks:
