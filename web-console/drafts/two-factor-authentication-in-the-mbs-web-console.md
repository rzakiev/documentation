# Two-factor authentication in the MBS Web Console

## Introduction

In addition to the regular authentication with login and password, the MBS Web Console also offers two-factor authentication for users that require an extra layer of security for their MBS account. This two-factor authentication is based on the Google Authenticator app which generates a code that needs to be entered each time you attempt to log in to the MBS Web Console. That way you can ensure that no cyber malefactor can take hold of your account because authentication cannot be performed without your smartphone that serves as an ancillary authentication key.

There are three steps to enabling two-factor authentication in the MBS Web Console:

1. Download and install the Google Authenticator App from either the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605#?platform=iphone) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) depending on the operating system installed on your smartphone.
2. Enable two-factor authentication in the MBS Web Console's settings.
3. Establish a connection between the Google Authenticator app and the MBS Web Console by scanning a QR code in the Console's settings.

Once you've downloaded and installed the Google Authenticator app, proceed to enable the two-factor authentication in the MBS Web Console's settings.

## Enabling Two-Factor Authentication in the MBS Web Console

To enable two-factor authentication, go to the MBS Web Console. Under **Settings**, open the **General** tab. Select the **Enable 2-step verification** checkbox.

A pop-up window will appear, prompting you to launch the Google Authenticator app and scan the newly generated QR code.

Launch the Google Authenticator app, tap on the plus icon in the navigation bar, and then tap **Scan barcode**.

Scan the code in the pop-up window and then enter the code generated by the Google Authenticator app:

Click **Validate**. Shortly after the two-factor authentication will be enabled.

From now on, whenever you attempt to log in to the MBS Web Console, you will be prompted to enter the verification code in addition to the login and password.

**Note**: if you delete the Google Authenticator app from your phone, access to your MBS account will be temporarily lost. You'll have to contact the MBS support team and ask them to disable two-factor authentication which in the end might take a while. To avoid having this issue, make sure to disable two-factor authentication in the MBS Web Console before you delete the Google Authenticator app from your phone.
